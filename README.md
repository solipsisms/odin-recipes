# odin-recipes

i started the odin project today as i have been getting more into solidifying my skills in web development (more frontend for now).

this is the recipes project, just after learning some basics in html. so far it has been a lot of review for me, but i have never gotten to work on a full fledged project by myself with no tutorials, so this should be an exciting process even if the final project does turn out a little underwhelming.
